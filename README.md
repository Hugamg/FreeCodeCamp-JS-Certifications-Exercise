# FreeCodeCamp — JS Certifications Exercise

This repository contains my solutions for the **freeCodeCamp JavaScript Certification** exercises.

**Important:** I’m starting from the **Loops** section because I don’t have the earlier exercises saved.

---

## 📁 Repository structure

- Solutions are organized by **category/section** (as in the freeCodeCamp curriculum).
- Each solution is a **plain `.txt` file** (prompt + my code in the same file).
- File names use only:
  - the **exercise number (in order)**  
  - the **exercise title**

---

## ✅ Naming convention

Inside each category folder, files follow this format:

Example:
- `001-working-with-loops.txt`
- `002-build-a-sentence-analyzer.txt`

This keeps the folder automatically sorted in the correct order.

## 🔎 What’s inside each `.txt` file?

Most `.txt` files contain:
1) the freeCodeCamp exercise instructions / prompt  
2) my code solution

### Tip for readability (without changing file format)
At the top of each `.txt`, keep a simple separator:

```txt
--- PROMPT ---
(paste prompt here)

--- SOLUTION ---
(paste code here)
